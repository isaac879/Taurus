# Taurus
Taurus is the robot scorpion I made my BEng project.

It uses a Raspberry Pi 3 programmed with Python as the controller board and 3 16-channel PWM board to control the 35 servos and eye colour. A PS3 controller connects to the Pi 3 via Bluetooth to control it. It is mostly made from 3D printed PLA, acrylic and aluminium.
